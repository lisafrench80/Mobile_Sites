Mobile_Sites
============

THESE ARE NOT FOR REUSE.  THESE ARE ALL COPYRIGHTED TO THE SITES OWNERS AND ARE NOT FREE FOR REPRODUCTION. 

Please also note that the way the sites/mobile sites are structured/coded is as per the persons request.  I code in a way that is comfortable for the person programming the back-end and for this reason, you will likely notice several things aren't in shorthand but rather (and quite literally) done in long hand: ie...padding-top, padding-bottom, padding-left, padding-right, instead of combining them into one statement.  This is done at the programmers/company owners request since he is not well versed in css and needs to know exactly what he is editing once I had the code back over to him and he installs it onto his customized CMS.
Strictly mobile sites, not responsive.
